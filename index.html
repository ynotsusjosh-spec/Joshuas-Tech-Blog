    <p> Seeing as this is my first blog, please go easy on me. I don't know much about what I am doing. I will do somethings that would seem random, like making text a different color, but that is to help ingrain what I am learning deeper into my mind.</p>
    <p> If you were wondering I am currently writing this using <a href="https://codepen.io/"> https://codepen.io/</a> which is a pretty useful and easy to use website. Using <a href="https://chatgpt.com/"> ChatGPT</a> makes this 10 times easier. I think that I can learn so much faster this way. And for the judges, I did not use it to write the code. I used it to learn the code. If you think coding would be cool but think that it is to hard, then prepare to have your mind blown. It took me only about 1 hour to learn how to write this and add <span style="color: red;"> some color to my texts</span>, and to write that text in red it took like 2 minutes to learn it when I asked chatgpt to tell me how to write it. You have to use the span feature. Trust me it's not that difficult to learn coding. Try it.</p>
    <p> Goodbye, I will update this periodically for fun and to inform.</p>
